\section*{Conclusion}

To use the Wagelmans and Kolen \cite{Wagelmans&Kolen92} idea to perform the Thomas's algorithm \cite{Thomas70} isn't possible or in fact the asset of this method can't balance the difficult to compare the different slope and thus it don't allow to decrease the complexity of the algorithm which is our
purpose. 

We have study different model for the adding of the marketing effect, each model have its own assets and disavantages, no one is really perfect but may be they can lead to a better model. For example the discret model can add a delay effect but it use a binary variable which is very binding and it is further of the reality contrary to the continue models whoses can't easily add a delay effect but they can add the sale effect which can close theses models to the reality.

For a personnel effect this placement allowed me to understand a bit more about the research and its way of proceed, where the most important is not really the results but the understanding of the methods and that it is such important to know if our idea is feasible or not. It is an idea that we don't have the habit. Moreover this placement is a way to introduced some tools usefull for the research such as R, Latex, Git or Python.
